# Elevator Challenge

## Overview
Welcome to the Elevator Simulation Challenge! This console application is designed to simulate the movement of elevators within a large building, optimizing passenger transportation efficiently. The application adheres to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity and maintainability.

## Key Features
1. **Real-Time Elevator Status**: Displays the real-time status of each elevator, including current floor, direction of movement, motion status, and the number of passengers it is carrying.
2. **Interactive Elevator Control**: Allows users to interact with the elevators through the console. Users can call an elevator to a specific floor and indicate the number of passengers waiting.
3. **Multiple Floors and Elevators Support**: Designed to accommodate buildings with multiple floors and elevators, ensuring efficient movement between different floors.
4. **Efficient Elevator Dispatching**: Implements an algorithm to direct the nearest available elevator to respond to a request, minimizing wait times and optimizing usage.
5. **Passenger Limit Handling**: Considers the maximum passenger limit for each elevator, prevents overloading, and handles scenarios requiring additional elevators.
6. **Consideration for Different Elevator Types**: Plans for future extensions to accommodate various elevator types, such as high-speed, glass, and freight elevators.
7. **Real-Time Operation**: Operates in real-time, providing immediate responses to user interactions and accurately reflecting elevator movements and status.
